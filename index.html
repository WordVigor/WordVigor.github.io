    <h1>Tennessee Badasses of the Past</h1>

    <p>Whatever wilted misconceptions others outside our great state have of Tennesseans (the tired ol’ barefoot and pregnant images of our women, and the tobacco-spittin,’ free-cussin’ ones of our men spring wearily to mind), this is actually a state forged
        by Honey-Badger-tough-badasses. These vivid Volunteer State characters were not bad-assed for its own black leather-cool’s-sake alone. Oh, no. These badasses were on worthy missions, and they have stormed across our feisty state’s 215-year history
        being human Honey Badgers of incredible service and accomplishment. A few pesky human predators messed with our Tennessee badasses, but whether through sleight of pen, bite of teeth, or twang of guitar, our heroes easily deflected any challenges
        to their legacies to this state and nation.</p>

    <p>If you are unfamiliar with Honey Badgers, a brief overview will be instructive at this point. This ferocious creature lives in much of Africa and other parts of the world, but nowhere in the United States. Maybe we should say a big “thank God” on
        the end of that, for a Honey Badger is one of the top badasses of all creation; even Davy Crocket himself, for all his bear-killing prowess and coon-tail-wearing feistiness might have been hesitant to engage a Honey Badger. This is an alpha-creature
        that literally has swag--it arrogantly struts around with the confident aim to successfully plunder beehives, chase off lions, and kill puff adders. As a result, Honey Badgers do not have any natural predators; they fend those pests off with much
        hissing of intimidating, sharp teeth and slashing of equally daunting claw. Their hides are virtually impenetrable.</p>
