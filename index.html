    <h1>Tennessee Badasses of the Past</h1>

    <p>Whatever wilted misconceptions others outside our great state have of Tennesseans (the tired ol’ barefoot and pregnant images of our women, and the tobacco-spittin,’ free-cussin’ ones of our men spring wearily to mind), this is actually a state forged
        by Honey-Badger-tough-badasses. These vivid Volunteer State characters were not bad-assed for its own black leather-cool’s-sake alone. Oh, no. These badasses were on worthy missions, and they have stormed across our feisty state’s 215-year history
        being human Honey Badgers of incredible service and accomplishment. A few pesky human predators messed with our Tennessee badasses, but whether through sleight of pen, bite of teeth, or twang of guitar, our heroes easily deflected any challenges
        to their legacies to this state and nation.</p>

    <p>If you are unfamiliar with Honey Badgers, a brief overview will be instructive at this point. This ferocious creature lives in much of Africa and other parts of the world, but nowhere in the United States. Maybe we should say a big “thank God” on
        the end of that, for a Honey Badger is one of the top badasses of all creation; even Davy Crocket himself, for all his bear-killing prowess and coon-tail-wearing feistiness might have been hesitant to engage a Honey Badger. This is an alpha-creature
        that literally has swag--it arrogantly struts around with the confident aim to successfully plunder beehives, chase off lions, and kill puff adders. As a result, Honey Badgers do not have any natural predators; they fend those pests off with much
        hissing of intimidating, sharp teeth and slashing of equally daunting claw. Their hides are virtually impenetrable.</p>

    <p>But speaking of Davy Crocket—and we were before our fascinating digression into the relevant point of just how badassed Honey Badgers are—he’s a great way to segue to our list of the Top 10 Tennessee Badasses. OF COURSE, Davy Crockett is on our list.
        But wait…didn’t David Letterman establish a protocol for Top 10 lists? Because Davy is not #10 on the list, which is where we start….</p>

        <hr>

    <p> #11. Ida Bell Wells-Barnett. Usually called just “Ida B. Wells,” we include this renowned educator’s full name here because it just looks more formidable than the shorter version. And if there is something this badass was, it was most definitely FORMIDABLE.
        Ida chomped down on a rude train attendant’s demanding hand in a clear demonstration of “no, I don’t WANT to move seats just because I am black” that took place a full 50 years before Rosa Parks became famous for her worthy, but less dramatic,
        civil disobedience.</p>

    <p> #10. Alex Haley. Not a Tennessee-born badass, we still claim him as ours, as is the case with several on our list. You don’t have to be BORN in Tennessee to be claimed as one of our badasses…you just have to have committed some major portion of your
        time, life and/or gifts to our state. And, oh did Haley gave gifts to our state, as well as to our nation, in writing the sweeping, saga “Roots.” It is said that it was while swinging on the front porch of his grandparent’s Henning, Tennessee
        home that Haley first heard the stories that gave rise to the protagonist Kunta Kinte. Not only was Haley raised in Henning, population about 900, it is there, near the Alex Haley Museum, that he is laid to well-earned rest.</p>

    <p>#9. Jourdan Anderson. (PHOTO UNAVAILABLE DUE TO THE COMPLETE DEHUMIZATION OF SLAVES.) This character actually FLED Tennessee for Ohio after the Civil War, but he’s on our list of badasses for doing so. After all, he fits our definition of having given
        significant gifts and time to this state. He was forced to do just that: give his hard work in the prime of his life as a FREE gift to Old Master, Col. P.H. Anderson. Anderson illustrates that bad-ass-ness does NOT have to come from angry outbursts
        or violent actions. Anderson wrote (probably dictated) a letter to his former slave master that is one of the all-time classics of letter writing. Short summary: Anderson tells Old Master, in a MOST elegant, understated way, to stick it where
        the hot Tennessee summer sun won’t ever shine. Worth reading in its entirety (http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/to-my-old-master.html), here are a few truly memorable lines of such restrained bird-flipping power: </p>

    <p>#8. Johnny Cash. From a badassed black man not-interested in returning to Old Master, to a badassed man in black, Tennessee’s large tome of characters really do astound in their “can’t make this s*&^ up” diversity. This gravelly-voiced country music
        singer is a microcosm of the much bigger picture in this state of singing badasses. Tennessee history, particularly Nashville’s, is resplendent with the brawling human dramas brought to twangy reality by astonishing musicians. Johnny Cash always
        wore black to protest against injustices among those less fortunate. His steely-eyed, unsmiling demeanor screamed BADASS! But his love of the downtrodden was genuinely touching.</p>

    <p>#7. Elvis Presley. Of course, if we are going to include Johnny, we HAVE to include Elvis! The King of Rock N Roll was badass-ness personified. (Realization: This article could careen off to a brilliant musician-only focus, but that path will stop
        here. The other badassed musicians of Tennessee will have to be highlighted later.) Elvis was another big-hearted badass who fulfilled a musical genius so prolific as to defy the abilities of mere mortals. </p>

    <p>#6. Andrew Jackson. Perhaps the closest possible personification to a Honey Badger, Jackson’s entire demeanor suggests he actively sought out honey bee hives to disturb. Orphaned at 14, by which time he had already been scarred during his Revolutionary
        War service at age 13 by a British soldier’s slashing sword, there is so much badass material in Jackson’s life that he could easily have several pages written on him alone. One endearing illustration of Jackson’s badass-ness is his dueling and
        killing a man over a slight to his beloved wife, Rachel.</p>

    <p>#5. Buford Pusser. A badass sheriff so legendary that a movie, “Walking Tall,” was made about his efforts to clean up vice in McNairy County, Pusser made famous the line “walk softly and carry a big stick” (or, we assume from this classic vintage
        photo of him, a big rifle).</p>

    <p>#4. Wilma Rudolph. Okay, tell me I can’t walk, ever, and I’ll…I’ll…I’ll…RUN! Yeah! I’ll run so well I’ll win the Olympics! You heard me right…I’m going to win the Olympics! Rudolph is proud representation of the ramrod-stubborn streak within our state’s
        DNA that taunts “Oh yes I CAN!” She survived bouts of polio and scarlet fever to not only achieve sports stardom, but to contribute her intelligent service to the causes of civil and women’s rights.</p>

    <p>#3. Pat Summitt. While we are on the track of phenomenal women athletes, Summitt is a natural top Badass. Not only did she lead the Lady Vols basketball team to records unimaginable, she has fought bravely against Alzeheimer’s. Leave it to a Tennessean
        to turn even a personal battle with Alzheimer’s into a public awareness campaign to help others. We love you, Pat!</p>

    <p>#2. Cordell Hull. Of COURSE we have a Nobel Peace Prize winner on our list of Tennessee badasses! Of course. Well, okay…he almost DIDN’T make the cut. At first, it was like a token placement of “YES, we DO have Nobel Peace Prize winners from Tennessee!”
        But upon further research, Hull’s lower-key-Badass-ness was polished to a fine shine. Not a magnetic personality or smooth orator, Hull was, in fact rather shy and reserved. But this quote from Hull’s biography on nobelprize.org makes us wave
        wild Rocky Top arms of pride over this hidden gem:</p>

    <p>#1. Davy Crockett. Of course you knew Crockett would be #1 on this list. He is the iconic representation of rugged Tennessee survival. He is also another of the “transplants” crowd like Haley. Crockett was actually born in North Carolina. Tennesseans-by-choice
        are perhaps the most endearing of all our inhabitants. Crockett could obviously have hacked his bear-killing way to any other state, but he chose Tennessee. The best thing about Crockett, as is representative of our people, is that you might look
        at the coonskin cap and think “backwoods hick.” He was actually a ferociously intelligent man who succeeded in many business and political adventures.</p>
